# Operatorial Approaches to Classical Mechanics.

The objective of the project was to study various operatorial approaches
to classical mechanics. We started with understanding the foundations of
Koopman- von Neumann Mechanics and the key differences in its opera-
torial language that set it apart from Quantum Mechanics. We then used
the KvN formalism to evaluate the free particle and successfully mapped it
back to the Newtonian free particle. Next, we solved for the general eigen-
states Ïˆ nm of Liouvillian in the Harmonic Oscillator system. We also veri-
fied the credibility of the found eigenstates.
The next operatorial approach was derived from the irreducible represen-
tation of the Galilei group. We studied the postulated Lie Algebra of the
group and re-examined Free particle and Harmonic Oscillator using this
approach. Here, we found that the results match with those found using
the KvN approach. With this, we confirmed that the two approaches are
indeed equivalent.
Then, we studied the Anharmonic Oscillator with cubic perturbation. We
found the general states with linear order approximation. Further, we com-
pared the evolution of the found state in time with the state found through
using classical perturbation theory. Finally, we moved on to examine the
Central Potential system where we first found the Liouvillian in polar co-
ordinates. Then we calculated the dynamics of all observables of the sys-
tem and saw that angular momentum is conserved as expected.
In the future, we aim to further study the central potential system and an-
harmonic oscillator. We would like to find ways to better approximate the
general state of anharmonic oscillator using perturbative approach.
